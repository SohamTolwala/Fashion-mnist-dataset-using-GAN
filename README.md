# Fashion-mnist-dataset-using-GAN
Train GAN to generate realistic fashion images resembling Fashion MNIST dataset. GAN has generator (creates images) and discriminator (distinguishes real vs. generated). Objective: train GAN for visually similar fashion images matching dataset.


The Fashion MNIST dataset project using GAN involves training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic fashion images that resemble the real Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator that generates fashion images and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated images. The goal is to train the GAN to produce realistic fashion images that are visually similar to the original dataset.
